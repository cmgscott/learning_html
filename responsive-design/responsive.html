<!-- + responsive design means the website displays equally well in everything from widescreen monitors to mobile phones
     + this is accomplished through css media queries
       -> media queries lets html content be distinct css layouts, so the same website can be displayed as needed
     + for reference an article on responsive web design patterns to help determine how to collapse
       desktop->tablet->mobile: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/patterns?hl=en
     + a FLUID layout stretches and shrinks to fill the width of the screen, a FIXED-WIDTH layout has the same width
       regardless of the screen dimensions (fluid is typically for mobile, fixed for desktop
     + it's a good idea to start with the mobile layout and work your way up to the desktop version-->
