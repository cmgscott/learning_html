<!-- + responsive design means the website displays equally well in everything from widescreen monitors to mobile phones
     + this is accomplished through css media queries
       -> media queries lets html content be distinct css layouts, so the same website can be displayed as needed
     + for reference an article on responsive web design patterns to help determine how to collapse
       desktop->tablet->mobile: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/patterns?hl=en
     + a FLUID layout stretches and shrinks to fill the width of the screen, a FIXED-WIDTH layout has the same width
       regardless of the screen dimensions (fluid is typically for mobile, fixed for desktop
     + it's a good idea to start with the mobile layout and work your way up to the desktop version
     + to display images there are three things to consider: the device dimensions, the image dimensions, the device
       screen resolution
     + retina displays have twice as many pixels per inch, so each pixel is 4 standard kpixels (image needs to be
       twice as big) (numbers can vary)
     + it is recommended to stick to the 1x and 2x version of srcset for images less than 600px wide, and use
       srcset plus sizes method for bigger photos, reserve picture for when youre trying to do something real fancy -->
