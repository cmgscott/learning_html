       of its parent container (in this case the browser window), default height is based on the content it contains,

       boxes is based on the content it contains, not the width of the parent element
     + difference between DIV and SPAN: div is for block-level content while span is for inline content-->

        <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;
            elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>

        <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elements
            do not.</p>
