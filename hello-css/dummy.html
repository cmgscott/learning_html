                                                        so put base first then supplement with section-specific

        <p>This is a dummy page that helps us demonstrate reusable CSS
           stylesheets. <a href='hello-css.html'>Go back</a>.</p>

        <!-- below is an in-line css example, overriding it is impossible, and going through every page to update every
             element is not good -->

                                          style='color: #990000; text-decoration: line-through;'>obsolete link</a>?
            This is your chance!</p>
