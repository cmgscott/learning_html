        <h1>Hello, CSS</h1>

        <p>CSS lets us style HTML elements. Thereâ€™s also
          <a href='dummy.html'>another page</a> associated with this example.</p>

        <h2>List Styles</h2>

        <p>You can style unordered lists with the following bullets:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>disc</li>
            <li>circle</li>
            <li>square</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And you can number ordered lists with the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>decimal</li>
            <li>lower-roman</li>
            <li>upper-roman</li>
            <li>lower-alpha</li>
            <li>upper-alpha</li>
            <li>(and many more!)</li>
        </ol>
